/**
 * An event-sourced implementation of the {@link GraphDb graph database}. This implementation fixes the
 * concurrency problems in {@link BrokenEventGraphDb} by
 * introducing transactional coupling between constraint checking (e.g., "is the resulting graph acyclic?") and state
 * mutation (e.g., "add this edge"). The coupling is done by enforcing a dense order of the mutation events: if we
 * check the graph constraints at event sequence number N, then we insert the mutation event at sequence number N+1;
 * by construction, no other mutation can occur in between and thus the constraints are guaranteed to be met after
 * the N+1 mutation.
 * <p>
 * This simple example demonstrates the structural similarities between the CRUD approach (see
 * {@link CrudGraphDb}) and the event-sourced approach: in both cases, we
 * need to linearize state mutations in order to validate the graph constraints and perform the mutation atomically /
 * transactionally. In the CRUD implementation, we chose to linearize mutations with a distributed lock; in the
 * event-sourced implementation, we chose to linearize mutations with a {@link EventStore dense, ordered sequence of
 * mutation events}. Note that this difference is by choice and is not a principled difference between the CRUD and
 * the event-sourced approaches: for instance, we could linearize the mutations with locks in the event-sourced
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * The optimistic locking approach chosen here exhibits the typical performance penalty when N users perform
 * concurrent mutations: N-1 out of N concurrent mutation attempts fail because their optimistic lock on the sequence
 * number eventually fails; notably, these N-1 attempts have already done the constraint checking, thus wasting a lot
 * of compute time. A better strategy would be to linearize the mutations: locally via a synchronized queue, or in a
 * distributed system via leader election. Interestingly, one of the main selling points of the event-sourced design
 * seems to evaporate (at least in theory): due to the performance penalty of optimistic locking, we should pick a
 * single actor to perform all mutations, or we should use distributed locks to coordinate... just like in a
 * transactional CRUD store.
